## 👥 Role-Based Functionalities (Member Access Guide)

SmartHR Nexus implements a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system with 5 distinct roles. Each role is served a tailored dashboard and set of features:

### 1. 👑 Super Admin
* **System-wide Settings:** Access to global settings, theme preferences, active integrations, and system logs.
* **Access Control:** Promotes, demotes, or deactivates user accounts.
* **Infrastructure Management:** Monitors database and Redis connection health statistics.
* **Full CRUD Scope:** Holds override rights for all employee records, department structures, and financial logs.

### 2. 🛡️ Admin (HR Operations)
* **Employee Directory:** Perform CRUD operations on employee profiles (Add, Edit, View, and Soft Delete). Handles avatar uploads, education/experience logging, and skills tags.
* **Payroll Processing:** Calculates CTC, basic salaries, HRA, allowances, professional taxes, and PF deductions. Automates payslip generation (PDF format) and processes payouts.
* **Department Management:** Creates and manages organizational departments (Engineering, HR, Sales, Product, Marketing, Finance, Design, Operations), configures budgets, and assigns Department Heads.
* **Analytics & Reports:** Generates system-wide summaries, exportable attendance reports, and payroll histories.

### 3. 💼 Senior Manager
* **Team Dashboard:** Displays real-time attendance, daily check-in statuses, and overall performance ratings of direct reports.
* **Leave Approvals:** Real-time workflow (Approve/Decline) for team leave requests. Approving dynamically deducts from the employee's respective leave balance.
* **Performance Evaluations:** Submits quarterly/annual performance reviews, scores key metrics (technical, communication, teamwork, leadership, productivity), and triggers **AI Performance Insights** for recommendations.

### 4. 🎯 HR Recruiter
* **Job Listings:** Creates and manages public/internal job listings, outlining requirements, salary ranges, experience, and remote/hybrid work modes.
* **Visual Candidate Pipeline:** Interactive drag-and-drop pipeline board tracking applicants across 8 hiring stages (Applied, Screening, Shortlisted, HR Interview, Technical Interview, Offer Sent, Hired, Rejected).
* **AI Resume Screening:** Uploads PDF/Docx resumes and processes them through the **Gemini AI Engine**. Returns a compatibility score (0-100), key strengths, weaknesses, and a structured hiring recommendation.

### 5. 🧑‍💻 Employee (Self-Service)
* **Personal Dashboard:** View daily check-in times, upcoming leaves, pending performance reviews, and notifications.
* **Real-time Attendance:** One-click check-in and check-out tracking (Status: Present, Late, Absent, On Leave).
* **Leave Center:** Submits leave requests with date selectors and reason descriptions. Displays real-time balances for Annual, Sick, Casual, Maternity, Paternity, and Unpaid leaves.
* **My Payslips:** Securely view and download PDF payslips for previous pay cycles.
* **My Performance:** Completes self-assessments, views manager feedback, and tracks progress on personal goals.

## 🧠 Core System Concepts

### 1. AI Engine (Google Gemini Integration)
* **ARIA HR Chatbot:** A floating voice-and-text chatbot accessible from any dashboard. It provides answers to company policy questions, helps calculate leave balances, and interfaces with the database to retrieve user-specific information.
* **AI Resume Scorer:** Uses Gemini Flash/Pro to parse resumes, compare text against job descriptions, and output standard JSON evaluations (score, summary, strengths, weaknesses).
* **Performance Insights:** Generates actionable growth summaries and coaching points based on manager review scores.
* **Payroll Optimizer:** Recommends tax-efficient structures for allowances and deductions to optimize the employee's in-hand salary.

### 2. Security & Session Lifecycle
* **Dual-Token System:** Authenticates with a short-lived JSON Web Token (Access Token) passed via HTTP headers and a long-lived Refresh Token stored in a secure, `httpOnly` cookie.
* **Redis Token Blacklisting:** On sign-out, the user's access token is cached in Redis with a TTL matching the token expiry. Any subsequent request with a blacklisted token is rejected.
* **Account Lockout:** Locks accounts for 2 hours after 5 consecutive failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
* **Soft Delete:** The database uses schema pre-middlewares to automatically exclude records containing a `deletedAt` timestamp from standard query results.

### 3. Real-time Infrastructure (WebSockets)
* **Socket.IO Rooms:** Users are joined to rooms matching their role (`role:admin`, `role:senior_manager`, etc.) and individual ID (`user:<id>`).
* **Live Notifications:** Dispatches real-time pop-ups for attendance check-ins, leave submissions, and approval status changes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* Node.js 18+
* MongoDB 6+ (or Atlas connection string)
* Redis 7+ (or Upstash Redis)
* Google Gemini API key ([Get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityakr1108/SmartHR-Nexus-AI-Workforce-Platform.git
cd SmartHR-Nexus-AI-Workforce-Platform

# Install root, frontend, and backend packages
npm run install:all
```

### 2. Configure Backend Environment
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `backend/.env` and configure at minimum:
* `MONGODB_URI` — MongoDB connection string.
* `REDIS_URL` — Redis server URI.
* `JWT_SECRET` & `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` — Long random strings.
* `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Your Gemini API Key.

### 3. Configure Frontend Environment
```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env
```
* Keep `VITE_API_URL=/api/v1` for Vite proxies.
* Add your `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` for client-side chat widgets.

### 4. Run the Development Servers
From the repository root, run both servers concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
# → Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# → Backend:  http://localhost:5000
```

### 5. Seed the Database
Seed mock departments, profiles, attendance records, payslips, leaves, and applications:
```bash
cd backend
node src/utils/seeder.js --reset
```
